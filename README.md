# checkout
An example checkout program built in HTML, CSS and Javascript. <br>
The checkout accepts four 'items' - A, B, C, and D. <br>
It uses the modulus operator to factor in the special offers on items A and B. <br>
There is a function to cancel the last item 'scanned', and another to cancel the entire transaction. <br>
A print-receipt function acts as a unit test, showing the user what items have been passed through the checkout.
